**The Spiral** (*ðə ˈspaɪərᵊl*), also known as **Sinkhole Sickness**, is a geological phenomenon
discovered in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1994, and observed elsewhere throughout the greater United
States in the late 1990s. While many anecdotal accounts exist, the spiral's brief appearances,
psychological effects on witnesses, and general lack of financial interest have made sufficient
geological surveys effectively impossible. Therefore the accounts presented here should be taken
with a grain of salt.
