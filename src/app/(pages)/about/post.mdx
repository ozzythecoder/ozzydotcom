ozzy the painter doesn't paint, is not named ozzy, and is not "the" anything, definitively. they
write rap music, develop software, play video games, and have more recently begun a foray into documenting
the end of days. they have a few mental illnesses, a few hyperfixations, a difficulty with
follow-through, and a level of unearned guilt that approaches catholicism.

you've arrived at the intersection of these disparate elements. this digital record will act as
a catalogue of art, learning, consciousness, and anger, both internal and worldly, both urgent and
temporally detached. due to the encroaching spite and cynicism that our digital infrastructure
grows increasingly reliant on, we have found it acceptable to allow ozzy to document their thoughts here
indefinitely, or until such time that it becomes an undue burden upon the noosphere.

we hope that the contents of this site will provide comfort to your endeavors, or fuel for whatever
you hope to burn down. â€¢
